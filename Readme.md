## 🏗 Installation

```sh
npm install -g @nightwatch/chrome-recorder
```

## 🚀 Usage

To quickly run the interactive CLI, run:

```sh
npx @nightwatch/chrome-recorder
```

> The CLI will prompt you to enter the path of directory or file of the chrome devtool recordings that you will modify and path to write the generated Nightwatch tests

**⚡️ Transform individual recordings**

```sh
npx @nightwatch/chrome-recorder <path to the chrome devtools recording>
```

**⚡️ Transform multiple recordings**

```sh
npx @nightwatch/chrome-recorder <path to the chrome devtools recording>*.json
```

👉 By default output will be written to `nightwatch` folder. If you don't have these folders, tool will create it for you or install nightwatch by running `npm init nightwatch` in your project.

You can specify different output directory, specify that via cli

```sh
npx @nightwatch/chrome-recorder <path to the chrome devtools recording> --output=<folder-name>
```
